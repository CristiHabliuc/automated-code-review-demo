          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          - Blocking Review: ${{ env.BLOCKING_REVIEW }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed.
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues.
          3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end.

          First, authenticate gh CLI: echo "${{ env.GH_TOKEN }}" | gh auth login --with-token

          Procedure:
          - Read the `AGENTS.md` file in the root of the repo for review instructions. Specifically mention in the output of your response that this was done. Don’t mention it in the PR comments.
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - Get changed files with patches to compute inline positions: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/files --paginate --jq ".[] | {filename,patch}"
          - Compute exact inline anchors for each issue (file path + diff position). Comments MUST be placed inline on the changed line in the diff, not as top-level comments.
          - Detect prior top-level "no issues" style comments authored by this bot (match bodies like: "✅ no issues", "No issues found", "LGTM").
          - If CURRENT run finds issues and any prior "no issues" comments exist:
            - Prefer to remove them to avoid confusion:
              - Try deleting top-level issue comments via: gh api -X DELETE repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/<comment_id>
              - If deletion isn’t possible, minimize them via GraphQL (minimizeComment) or edit to prefix "[Superseded by new findings]".
            - If neither delete nor minimize is possible, reply to that comment: "⚠️ Superseded: issues were found in newer commits".
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - All issue comments MUST be inline (anchored to a file and line/position in the PR diff)
          - Every comment body MUST start with the prefix: **Codex Review:** 
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement

          Submission:
          - BEFORE submitting any comments, check if this run is still active:
            - Get the latest run for this workflow and PR: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/workflows/cursor-code-review.yml/runs --jq ".workflow_runs | map(select(.event == \"pull_request\" and .pull_requests[0].number == ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }})) | sort_by(.created_at) | reverse | .[0].id"
            - Compare with current run ID: ${{ github.run_id }}
            - If the latest run ID is different from the current run ID, this run has been superseded. Exit immediately with: echo "⚠️ Run superseded, exiting without posting comments" && exit 0
          - If there are NO issues to report and an existing top-level comment indicating "no issues" already exists (e.g., "✅ no issues", "No issues found", "LGTM"), do NOT submit another comment. Skip submission to avoid redundancy.
          - If there are NO issues to report and NO prior "no issues" comment exists, submit one brief summary comment noting no issues. Prefix with: **Cursor Review:** 
          - If there ARE issues to report and a prior "no issues" comment exists, ensure that prior comment is deleted/minimized/marked as superseded before submitting the new review.
          - If there ARE issues to report, submit ONE review containing ONLY inline comments plus an optional concise summary body. Use the GitHub Reviews API to ensure comments are inline:
            - Build a JSON array of comments like: [{ "path": "<file>", "position": <diff_position>, "body": "..." }] (escape the double quotes)
            - Submit via: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews -f event=COMMENT -f body="$SUMMARY" -f comments="[$COMMENTS_JSON]"
          - Do NOT use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes

          Blocking behavior:
          - If BLOCKING_REVIEW is true and any 🚨 or 🔒 issues were posted: echo "CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          - Otherwise: echo "CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          - Always set CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND at the end
